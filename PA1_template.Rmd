## Loading and preprocessing the data
The data to be read is the zipped file named "activity.csv"
```{r}
unzip(zipfile = "activity.zip")
RawData <- read.csv("activity.csv",header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(RawData)
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
RawData$date <- as.Date(as.character(RawData$date))
TotalStespbyDay <- aggregate(steps~date, RawData, sum)
mean(TotalStespbyDay$steps)
hist(x=TotalStespbyDay$steps, xlab = "Steps per day")
mean(TotalStespbyDay$steps)
median(TotalStespbyDay$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
MeanStepsbyDay <- aggregate(steps~date, RawData, mean)
plot(MeanStepsbyDay$steps~MeanStepsbyDay$date, type="l", xlab="Date", ylab="Mean Steps in a day", main="Time Series of Average Seps per Day")


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
